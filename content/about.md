As I mentioned in sidebar, this is a totally independent blog that Stand Alone with my real life. I've been spent nearly two months to publish this blog, without losing any functions I want.  

My name is kiersonal. also, a Stand Alone name seperate with all of my social media, although I no longer use them anymore, Software Engineering was my major, and that's why I so pursue such a product my own and why I'm a little bit geek.

Thanks to great Internet, i could found some help on the websites below, which is also what i want to thanks!
